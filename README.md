Comparing various factors like education, job and experience against salary have been plotted using Area , Bar and whisker charts.Line chart depicting Automation probability for jobs have been shown where in we understand job categories like Customer support, construction worker, retail worker and security guard shows sharp rise in probability of automation.And bar chart showing the risk categorisied as Low, Medium and High shows which job categories fall under which category. By that chart we can understand if the AI Exposure index is more the risk is Low and vice versa.
